# Hi, I'm Kristi Leka ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about open source and JVM-based technologies. I have 6 years of experience as a backend developer, with a focus on Java and Kotlin for 4 years, and Python for 2 years. I'm a big Scala enthusiast and I love exploring new design patterns and architectures, especially clean architecture, hexagonal architecture, and microservices.

## Skills

- Programming languages: Java, Kotlin, Python, Scala
- System design
- Design patterns: Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, Microservices
- JVM-based technologies

## Projects

- Clean Architecture Library Application: This project is built with Kotlin JVM and Spring Boot, and it follows clean architecture principles to achieve a highly maintainable and scalable codebase. The application uses Docker to containerize the environment and PostgreSQL as the database.
  
- Reactive Anagram Finder: This project is built with Spring Boot and Kotlin, and it provides a reactive solution for finding anagrams and performing operations on them. The application uses Coroutines for asynchronous processing and Docker for containerization. PostgreSQL is used as the database for storing words in a modularized way to optimize the performance of the application.

- Live Currency Converter: This project is built with Java and Spring Boot, and it provides real-time currency conversion by fetching daily currency exchange rates from the European Central Bank's CSV file. The application updates the exchange rates every day and provides real-time conversion using PostgreSQL as the database.
